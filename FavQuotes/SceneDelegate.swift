     I don't choose to load this project with SwiftUI by default because I found trouble dealing with some *functions* while implementing with SwiftUI. I did build a working SwiftUI version, though. Simply change LOAD_WITH_SWIFTUI to true to load the Scene with SwiftUI.
     
     *function*:
        1. Placeholder for TextEditor: I'm trying to solve it by using a Zstack. I'm thinking about aligning TextEditor and a placeholder label in Z direction. When the Text is not empty(the user entered something), I will set the background placeholder text's alpha to 0, and vice versa.
        2. Sync with CoreData immediately after the user exiting QuoteEditor. In NewQuoteViewController, I can easily do it with a callback. In SwiftUI though, the callback is automatically managed, so I have to passively sync when the app enters background. Still looking for solutions on StackOverflow...
        3. Deleting the Quote when user edit the current Quote to empty. Same thing with #2, I can't detect if the user emptied both TextView after exiting QuoteEditor.
